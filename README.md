Signal-synthesis
================

Renders specified frequencies with their respective amplitudes using HTML5/Javascript.

Frequencies are defined in the frequency box. First number represents frequency of one and it's value is the amplitude of that frequency, second number represents frequency of two and it's amplitude and so on...

I know this isn't entirely realistic. Just another toy program. I got bit inspired by some other similar visualisations of signals used in context of fourier transforms.
